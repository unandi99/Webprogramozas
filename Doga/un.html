    <h1>This is the main headline of the article</h1>
    <h2>This is a second level heading</h2>
    <p>Here comes the first paragraph of text that describes what this article will be about. <strong>Its   second sentence is so important it gets marked additionally.</strong></p>
    <p>"Then comes a longer quotation from long ago that makes you think."</p>
    <p>In the second paragraph there is nothing interesting. But after the second paragraph there is an image of a tree.</p>

    <h2>Another second level heading</h2>
    <p>Here comes a nested list to prove the author's point:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>with items</li>
      <li>under each other</li>
      <ul>
        <li>and second level items</li>
        <li>also</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>



    <p>A short table with the convincing numbers</p>
    <p><strong>first column	second column</strong></p>
    <p>data-1	data-2</p>
    <p>data-3	data-4</p>
    <p>And finally a link to <a href="">another website</a>.</p>
